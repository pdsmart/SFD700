# SFD-700
A Floppy Disk Interface card for the Sharp MZ series of machines (MZ-80B/MZ-80A/MZ-700/MZ-800/MZ-1500/MZ-2000/MZ-2200).

This project is based on an iconic floppy disk interface card from the 1980's by the Aachen based company, Kersten & Partner GmbH. The company produced two cards,
the SFD-700 for the Sharp MZ-700 and the SFD-800 for the Sharp MZ-800. I initially reproduced the SFD-800 from the original schematic and board which I owned, the
design can be seen here: https://eaw.app/sfd800/. The SFD-800 was quite a flexible design and worked in the MZ-80B/MZ-800/MZ-1500/MZ-2000/MZ-2200 computer. Unfortunately
it didnt cater for the Sharp MZ-700 or indeed the Sharp MZ-80A.

I considered reproducing the SFD-700 exactly but it wouldnt work in an MZ-80A which uses a hardware trick to address the CPU speed shortcomings. I thus decided, based on the
SFD-800, to create a version 2 of the SFD-700 design which would work in all the Sharp MZ series computers.

Please see my website (in due course), https://eaw.app for more documentation and any recent updates.
